# Procastify

**Turn Information into Understanding**

Procastify is an AI-first study and productivity platform built for students who struggle with distraction, passive learning, and fragmented study tools. It transforms raw information into structured understanding, actionable notes, and focused routines within a single calm workspace.

Rather than optimizing for time spent, Procastify optimizes for clarity of thinking.

## Overview

Most productivity tools focus on speed, streaks, and surface-level metrics. Procastify is built around a different principle:

**If you understand better, you procrastinate less.**

The platform supports a natural learning loop:

**Read → Understand → Remember → Test → Focus**

Every feature is intentionally designed to support this loop while staying lightweight and human-friendly.
